        <p class="para"> &#9734; Subhas Chandra Bose (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India—died August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan?)
           was an Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence movement against British rule of India.</p> 

       <p class="para"> &#9734; His attempts to get rid of the British with the help of the Nazi party and Imperial Japan during the time of the second world
      war left him a troubled legacy. Although every Indian feels proud by hearing his name, it was not the case during the freedom 
      struggle, especially in the INC where he often faced clashes of ideologies with Gandhiji and he did not get the recognition that
      he deserved.</p>
          
      <p class="headline" >&#8594; Education  </p>

       <p class="para">&#9734; Subhas Chandra Bose was the ninth out of the fourteen children of Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati </p> 
           
       <p class="para">&#9734; He attended the Protestant European School, which is now called Stewart High School, along with his other siblings in Cuttack.</p> 

       <p class="para">&#9734; He was a brilliant student and had a knack for knowing which earned him a second position in the matriculation exam.</p> 

       <p class="para">&#9734; He was a brilliant student and had a knack for knowing which earned him a second position in the matriculation exam.</p> 

       <p class="para">&#9734; He attended the Presidency College (now University) in Calcutta and was greatly influenced by the teachings and philosophies
           of Swami Vivekananda and Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansa Dev by reading their works when he was 16 years old.</p> 

       <p class="para">&#9734; He was later expelled by the college on grounds of assaulting a professor named Oaten even though he appealed that he was not
       even a participant in the act but only a mere spectator. This incident ignited a strong sense of rebellion in him and the 
       mistreatment of Indians at the hands of the British which he observed to be happening widespread in Calcutta only added fuel
       to the fire.</p>
       <p class="para">&#9734; He joined the Scottish Church College under the University of Calcutta where he completed his graduation in Philosophy
       in the year 1918.</p>
          
       <p class="para">&#9734; He then left for London with his brother Satish to prepare for the Indian Civil Services exam that used to be
       held during that time.</p>
          
       <p class="para">&#9734; He took the exam and passed with flying colours on the very first attempt, such a bright student he was!
       But he still had mixed feelings as he would now have to work under the government set up by the British whom he had already
       started to despise. So, in the year 1921, he resigned from the Indian Civil Services as a symbol of boycotting the British 
       after the incident of the infamous Jallianwala Bagh massacre.</p>

       <p class="headline" >&#8594;Role in Freedom Struggle  </p>

       <p class="para">&#9734; Subhas Chandra Bose joined the Indian National Congress (INC) under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi and started the newspapers
       called “Swaraj” which means self-governance which marks his entry into politics and his role in the freedom struggle in India has
        just started. Chittaranjan Das was his mentor. In the year 1923, he became the President of the All India Youth Congress
        and became the editor of the newspaper “Forward” started by C.R. Das himself. He had also been elected as the mayor of 
       Calcutta back then. He gained leadership spirit and made his way up to the top in the INC very soon. In 1928, the Motilal 
       Nehru Committee demanded Dominion Status in India but Subhash Chandra Bose along with Jawaharlal Nehru asserted that 
       nothing would satisfy other than complete independence of India from the British. Gandhiji strongly opposed the ways of
       Bose, who wanted independence by hook or by crook, as he was a firm believer of non-violence itself.</p> 
         
       <p class="para">&#9734; He was sent to jail in 1930 during the Civil Disobedience movement but was related along with other prominent leaders
       in the year 1931 when the Gandhi-Irwin pact was signed. In 1938, he was elected as President at the Haripura session 
       of the INC and re-elected at the Tripuri Session in 1939 by competing against Dr P. Sitaramayya who was supported by
       Gandhi himself. He maintained strict standards during the commencement of the first World War and demanded full 
       independence of India from the British within six months. He faced vehement objections from inside the Congress
       which led him to resign from INC and form a more progressive group called the “Forward Bloc”.</p> 


        <p class="para"> &#9734; He started a mass movement against using Indian men in the wars of foreign countries which received immense support
       and voice which led him to be put under house arrest in Calcutta but he left the house in disguise in January 1941
        and reached Germany via Afghanistan and met the Nazi leader there to seek help from them to drive the British away 
       from India. He also sought help from Japan. He made full use of the philosophy “an enemy's enemy is a friend”.</p>
         
       <p class="headline"> &#8594;Disappearance </p>

        <p class="para"> &#9734; In July 1943, he arrived in Singapore and took over the reins of the Indian Independence Movement started by
       Rash Behari Bose and organized the Azad Hind Fauj which is also known as the Indian National Army. who gave
       the title netaji to subhash chandra bose? It was at this time when Azad Hind Fauj named him “Netaji”, by which
       he is commonly referred to even today. The next few events have been blurry in the history of their struggle
       for independence by him.  </p> 
                 
                 
       <p class="para"> &#9734; INA liberated the Andaman and Nicobar islands but when it reached Burma, bad weather conditions, as well as the
        defeat of Japan and Germany in the Second World War, forced him to retreat. He is rumoured to have been killed in
       a plane crash in Taipei, Taiwan on August 18, 1945. Even though it is widely believed that he was still alive for
       many years after that. </p>

           <p class="topics">&#8594;A falling-out with Gandhi &#58;
          
          <p class="para"> &#9734; Vocal support for Gandhi increased within the Indian National Congress, meanwhile, and, in light of this, Gandhi resumed
          a more commanding role in the party. When the civil disobedience movement was started in 1930, Bose was already in
           detention for his associations with an underground revolutionary group, the Bengal Volunteers. Nevertheless, he was 
          elected mayor of Calcutta while in prison. Released and then rearrested several times for his suspected role in violent
          acts, Bose was finally allowed to proceed to Europe after he contracted tuberculosis and was released for ill health. 
          In enforced exile and still ill, he wrote The Indian Struggle, 1920&#x2010;1934 and pleaded India&apos;s cause with European leaders.
           He returned from Europe in 1936, was again taken into custody, and was released after a year.</p>

          <p class="para">&#9734; Meanwhile, Bose became increasingly critical of Gandhi&apos;s more conservative economics as well as his less confrontational
           approach toward independence. In 1938 he was elected president of the Indian National Congress and formed a national 
           planning committee, which formulated a policy of broad industrialization. However, this did not harmonize with Gandhian
           economic thought, which clung to the notion of cottage industries and benefiting from the use of the country&apos;s own 
          resources. Bose&apos;s vindication came in 1939, when he defeated a Gandhian rival for reelection. Nonetheless, the “rebel
          president” felt bound to resign because of the lack of Gandhi&apos;s support. He founded the Forward Bloc, hoping to rally
           radical elements, but was again incarcerated in July 1940. His refusal to remain in prison at this critical period of
          India&apos;s history was expressed in a determination to fast to death, which frightened the British government into releasing 
          him. On January 26, 1941, though closely watched, he escaped from his Calcutta residence in disguise and, traveling via Kabul 
          and Moscow, eventually reached Germany in April.</p>
          
          
              
            <p class="topics">&#8594;Activity in exile &#58;
              
              <p class="para">&#9734; A little more than a year after the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, Bose left Germany, traveling by German and
            Japanese submarines and by plane, and arrived in May 1943 in Tokyo. On July 4 he assumed leadership of the Indian
           Independence Movement in East Asia and proceeded, with Japanese aid and influence, to form a trained army of about
            40,000 troops in Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia. On October 21, 1943, Bose proclaimed the establishment of a
         provisional independent Indian government, and his so-called Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj), alongside
          Japanese troops, advanced to Rangoon (Yangon) and thence overland into India, reaching Indian soil on March 18, 1944
           and moving into Kohima and the plains of Imphal. In a stubborn battle, the mixed Indian and Japanese forces, lacking
         Japanese air support, were defeated and forced to retreat; the Indian National Army nevertheless for some time succeeded in
          maintaining its identity as a liberation army, based in Burma and then Indochina. With the defeat of Japan, however, Bose&apos;s 
          fortunes ended.<br>

         A few days after Japan&apos;s announced surrender in August 1945, Bose, fleeing Southeast Asia, reportedly died in a Japanese
          hospital in Taiwan as a result of burn injuries from a plane crash.</p>

          <p class="topics">&#8594;Death of Subhas Chandra Bose&#58; 
            <p class="para">&#9734; Bose died from third-degree burns after his plane crashed in Japanese Taiwan on 18 August 1945. 
          Some Indians did not believe that the crash had occurred,[s] expecting Bose to return to secure India's independence.
          The Indian National Congress, the main instrument of Indian nationalism, praised Bose's patriotism but distanced itself 
          from his tactics and ideology.[w][41] The British Raj, never seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers 
          with treason in the Indian National Army trials, but eventually backtracked in the face of opposition by the Congress,
          and a new mood in Britain for rapid decolonisation in India.</p>
        
          <button class="end"> &#9830; Bose's legacy is mixed. Among many in India, he is seen as a hero, his saga serving as a would-be 
        counterpoise to the many actions of regeneration, negotiation, and reconciliation over a quarter-century through which 
        the independence of India was achieved. His collaborations with Japanese fascism and Nazism pose serious ethical
         dilemmas,especially his reluctance to publicly criticize the worst excesses of German anti-Semitism from 1938 onwards 
         or to offer refuge in India to its victims.<br>

         Subhash Chandra Bose was a significant leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule. His contributions to
         the cause of freedom, including the formation of the Indian National Army and his ability to rally a large number of Indians 
         to the cause, have been recognized and celebrated. His legacy lives on and continues to inspire those who fight for freedom 
         and justice. Bose's death still remains a mystery and his contributions to the freedom of India will always be remembered and 
         celebrated.&#9830; </p> </button>
